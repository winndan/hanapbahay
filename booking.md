# Project Overview

The concept of my business is like Uber, but instead of cars, it's motorcycles.

I want to create a website that allows users to request a motorcycle ride, and then the motorcycle will be dispatched to the user.

I want to create 3 interfaces: admin, driver, and user.

I want to create a dashboard for the admin to manage the drivers and users.

I want to create a dashboard for the driver to manage the motorcycles and the rides.

I want to create a dashboard for the user to request a ride and track the ride.

## New Features

- **Login/Signup Page**: Users can create an account or log in to access their dashboards.
- **Home Page**: A landing page that provides information about the service and allows users to navigate to the login/signup page.
